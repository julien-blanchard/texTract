# **texTract**

Based on an old university project from 2008 and initially designed in Perl, TexTract is a lightweight and minimalist python module that takes a .txt file, and provides some context for any given token within the input corpus.

It was originally meant to be used from the command line to obtain basic insights from various novels in .txt format.

TexTract provides two main functionalities:

1. **Get context:**

Outputs the 5 previous and and 5 following contextual tokens for every iteration of the input token.
